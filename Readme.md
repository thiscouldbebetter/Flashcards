Flashcards
==========

The JavaScript program in this repository prompts for a lesson file, and, when one is provided, quizzes the user with the questions from it.  When the user answers all questions correctly the specified times in a row, the lesson is counted as complete.  To see it in action, open Flashcards.html in a web browser that runs JavaScript.

The lesson file should be a text file.  Each line in the file represents a question and its correct response, delimited by a semicolon.

A sample lesson is provided.  More lessons are linked from <a href="https://thiscouldbebetter.neocities.org/Flashcards/index.html">this page</a>.

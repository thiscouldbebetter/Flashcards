Flashcards
==========

The JavaScript program in this repository prompts for a lesson file, and, when one is provided, quizzes the user with the questions from it.  When the user answers all questions correctly the specified times in a row, the lesson is counted as complete.  To see it in action, open Flashcards.html in a web browser that runs JavaScript.

The lesson file is a text file.  Each question and answer should appear on adjacent lines, with a blank line in between each pair.  Optionally, multiple adjacent lines can be used for the question, as long as the answer is still the last line in the block.  Also, a line beginning with "<" will be interpreted as HTML and displayed on the page along with the rest of the question.  This is intended for including images.

A sample lesson is provided by default.  Additional lessons are available in the "Data" directory.
